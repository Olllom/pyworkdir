Python working directories.

### Quickstart

[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyworkdir/badges/installer/conda.svg)](https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge)

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pyworkdir
```

#### Basic Usage

```python
from pyworkdir import WorkDir

with WorkDir("some_directory"):
    # everything in this context is run 
    # in the specified directory
    pass 
```

#### Directories are Customizable Classes

Instances of `WorkDir` can be be customized by adding a file `workdir.py` to the directory.
All variables, functions, or classes defined in this file will be added as attributes of
the `WorkDir` instance.

For instance, consider the following `workdir.py` file:
```python
# -- workdir.py --
def data_file(workdir, filename="data.csv"):
    return workdir/filename
```

The function can now be accessed from other code as follows:
```python
from pyworkdir import WorkDir

with WorkDir() as wd:
    print(wd.data_file())
```

Note that the parameter `workdir` behaves like the `self` argument of the method. If `workdir` is not
an argument of the function, the function behaves like a static method.

By default, the `WorkDir` instance also recursively inherits attributes defined
in its parent directory's `workdir.py` files.
Therefore, subdirectories behave like subclasses.
